<p>8.	Indemnification</p>

<p>8.1.  	Indemnification for Violations. In Operating the Product, you agree to use only those materials for which you have the necessary patent, copyright and other permissions, licenses, and/or clearances.  You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Licensor and its respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns (the "Licensor Indemnitees") from any and all losses, liabilities, damages and claims, and all related expenses including without limitation reasonable legal fees and disbursements and costs of investigation, litigation, settlement, judgment, interest and penalties and costs related to, arising from, or in connection with any third-party claim related to, arising from, or in connection with the actual or alleged: (i) infringement by you or by Compiled Units  (except when such breach is exclusively attributable to Product) of any third-party intellectual property and/or proprietary right, including, but not limited to, patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, publicity and/or privacy, (ii) personal injury (including death) or property damage due to gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the Licensee, and (iii) breach by the Licensee of any of its representations, warranties, obligations, and/or covenants set forth herein. You shall promptly notify the Licensor in writing after you become aware of any such claims, but failure to give such notice shall not relieve you of indemnity obligations hereunder.  You shall have exclusive control over the settlement or defense of such claims or actions, except that Licensor may appear in the action, at its own expense, through counsel reasonably acceptable to you, only in the event it is mutually determined by the parties that an actual conflict of interest would exist by your representation of the Licensor and you in such action. Licensor shall give you, at your expense, all information and assistance reasonably requested by you to settle or defend such claims or actions.  You shall be entitled to retain all monetary proceeds, attorneys' fees, costs and other rewards you receive as a result of defending or settling such claims.  In the event you fail to promptly indemnify and defend such claims and/or pay Licensor's expenses, as provided above, Licensor shall have the right to defend itself, and in that case, you shall reimburse the Licensor Indemnitees for all of their attorneys' fees, costs and damages incurred in settling or defending such claims within thirty (30) days of each of Licensor's written requests.  Nothing in this Section 3.2 or this Agreement shall be interpreted as to exclude any possible legal recourse against the Licensee.</p>

You acknowledge receipt of and agree to the Licensor's privacy statement which is made available to you in connection with installation and is set forth in full at http://www.microolap/about/privacy/.  You hereby expressly consent to the Licensor's processing of your personal data (which may be collected by the Licensor or its distributors) according to the Licensor's current privacy policy as of the date of the effectiveness hereof which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference.  By entering into this Agreement, you agree that the Licensor may collect and retain information about you, including your name, email address and credit card information.  The Licensor may employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on its behalf.  Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, implementing fraud check policies, and providing customer service.  Such companies and individuals may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.  The Licensor publishes a privacy policy on the Licensor Site and may amend such policy from time to time in its sole discretion.  You should refer to the Licensor's privacy policy prior to agreeing to this Agreement for a more detailed explanation of how your information will be stored and used by the Licensor.  If "you" are an organization, you will ensure that each member of your organization (including employees and contractors) about whom personal data may be provided to the Licensor has given his or her express consent to the Licensor's processing of such personal data.  Personal data will be processed by the Licensor or its distributors in the country where it was collected.  The relevant laws in such jurisdictions regarding processing of personal data may be less or more stringent than the laws in your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>10.2.  	Public Announcements.  The Licensor may identify you to the public as a customer of the Licensor and describe in a customer case study the services and solutions delivered by the Licensor to you.  The Licensor may also issue one or more press releases, containing an announcement of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and/or the implementation of the Product by you.

<p>11.	Miscellaneous.</p>

<p>11.1.  	Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the British Virgin Islands without reference to conflicts of law rules and principles.  This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly disclaimed and excluded.  The courts within the British Virgin Islands shall have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute arising out of this Agreement.  You agree that this Agreement and any action, dispute, controversy, or claim that may be instituted based on this Agreement, or arising out of or related to this Agreement or any alleged breach thereof, shall be prosecuted exclusively in the courts of the British Virgin Islands and you, to the extent permitted by applicable law, hereby waive the right to change venue to any other state, county, district or jurisdiction; provided, however, that the Licensor as claimant shall be entitled to initiate proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>11.2.  	Period for Bringing Actions.  No action, regardless of form, arising out of the transactions under this Agreement, may be brought by either party hereto more than one (1) year after the cause of action has occurred, or was discovered to have occurred, except that an action for infringement of intellectual property rights may be brought within the maximum applicable statutory period.</p>

<p>11.3.  	Entire Agreement; Severability; No Waiver.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Licensor and supersedes any other prior agreements, proposals, communications or advertising, oral or written, with respect to the Product or to subject matter of this Agreement.  You acknowledge that you have read this Agreement, understand it and agree to be bound by its terms.  If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or in part, such provision will be more narrowly construed so that it becomes legal and enforceable, and the entire Agreement will not fail on account thereof and the balance of the Agreement will continue in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by law or equity while preserving, to the fullest extent possible, its original intent.  No waiver of any provision or condition herein shall be valid unless in writing and signed by you and an authorized representative of Licensor provided that no waiver of any breach of any provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach.  Licensor's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement or any right shall not be construed as a waiver of any such provision or right.</p>

<p>11.4.  	Contact Information.  Should you have any questions concerning this Agreement, or if you desire to contact the Licensor for any reason, please contact our Customer Department at sales@microolap.com.</p>
